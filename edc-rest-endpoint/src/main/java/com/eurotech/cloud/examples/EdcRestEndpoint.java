/**
 * This is an example of how to define a RESTful endpoint that can be used as a callback for the Everyware Cloud Rules Engine.
 * The callback can be programmed to respond to GET or POST requests. 
 * This example endpoint will store all the notifications it received in memory and report them 
 * when querying the REST call:
 * http://host:post/edc-rest-endpoint/report
 * 
 * For GET requests, query parameters can be used to send information about the event that triggered the rule.
 * The URL of the REST Rule Action can be parametrized using the names of the tokens selected by the Rule.
 * For example, the URL for a REST Rule Action based on GET HTTP method can be specified as the following:
 * http://host:post/edc-rest-endpoint/notify?topic=$semanticTopic&asset=$asset&int=$int
 * 
 * When a Rule is evaluated positively, the tokens prefixed by the dollar sign are substituted
 * with the corresponding value as returned by the evaluated Rule.
 *   
 * For POST requests, a full EdcMessage can be used to package information about the event that triggered the rule.
 * Follow the user interface in the Everyware Cloud Console to configure which parameters to include as metrics
 * in the EdcMessage sent as a body of the notification.  
 *
